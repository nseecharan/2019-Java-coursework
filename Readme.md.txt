I took a Java course in college, and created a few applications to demonstrate the programming concepts taught each week. Allow me to stress, these programs were never intended to be professionally finished, and only served as experiments in my learning. It's student work through and through, rife with the type of comments, and console logging you would expect.

That in mind, as I was focused on demonstrating the main concepts, so input checks, graceful error handling, and in some cases, even a clean way to exit a program was generally not implemented.

These errors might be fixed should I choose to revisit these applications, however for now they will remain as is.
