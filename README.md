# 2019-Java-coursework

I took a Java course in college, and created a few applications to demonstrate the programming concepts taught each week. Our prof was not interested in if the program ran, but instead, on how we chose to solve the assignment. This is why some projects have multiple runnables. Furthermore, these programs were never intended to be professionally finished, and only served as experiments in my learning. It's student work through and through, rife with the type of comments, and console logging you would expect.

That in mind, as I was focused on demonstrating the main concepts, so input checks, graceful error handling, and in some cases, even a clean way to exit a program was generally not implemented.

I'll fix these problems if I revisit these projects, however for now they will remain as is.

# Notes

projects 001 - 004 are strictly command line applications, but the remaining projects have some bundled applications with graphical user interfaces. Some Interfaces vary in quality.

# Bonus: Math Quiz App (007)
This was initially an application to demonstrate the use of a "set," for storing user inputs for a math game, but I decided to add more graphical features, and an intuitive way to review past attempt history. This project is not included in this repository, as I hope to add more game like features one day. Might even convert it into a mobile app.
