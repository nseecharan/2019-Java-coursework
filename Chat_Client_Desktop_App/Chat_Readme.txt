How To Use
=================================
For this app to work properly, you must first run the Server file (so that the message client can connect to it), and then run the ClientFx file to display a chat window.
You may run the ClientFx file as many times as you wish to open multiple chat windows, and log in as different users.

Themes
=================================
Add up to 11 of your own 500 X 600 png images to the image folder, and number them sequentially (1 - 11) to be able to set the background of the chat window with your images. You may then cycle through each image to set your preferred desired background.
